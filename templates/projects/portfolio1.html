        <p  class="logo_content">Pristine white in colour and loyalty in their veins, the personality of swans is worth being admired. This bird has its own glory in Indian culture. It is not only considered the “Vahan” or “Vehicle” of Saraswati, the goddess of learning but also a symbol of conscience in Indian literature. The life course of a human being is like a swan because it is possible to acquire knowledge everywhere. It is said that the swan is the only animal with a conscience - that is, it is the discretion to separate milk and water from water. It is believed that the swan chooses the pearl and releases the waste materials - as should be the understanding out of any kind of learning and teaching. The loyalty of swans is of paramount importance to humans. If out of a pair, one of the swans dies, the other spends their entire life alone. Like the law of the forest, they do not fight for female partners. They choose their partner on the basis of mutual understanding. A better and stronger sense of family bonding and social feelings are observed in them compared to other birds and animals. It is believed that when a person becomes perfect, he attains the intrinsic qualities of a swan, and when someone takes “Samadhi”, he says that he has become a “Paramahansa”. Paramahamsa is considered to be the greatest noble title in mankind in Indian culture. In our logo, the Convocation Cap on the Swan’s head reflects our belief in the importance of modern education. The books on which the swan is seated, reflect our scriptures. As an educational institution, our aim is to provide world-class education based on the “Shraman” culture that can prepare children to grow up as wise and noble citizens in the future. Our attempt is always to instill the values of kindness, loyalty, integrity, sensitivity, and rationality that Swans imbibe, in our students.</p>
